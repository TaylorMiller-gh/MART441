## **Week 9** ##

I had so much fun with this week's project. Things got tricky with parsing the JSON file, but I found a solution without too much searching.

Unfortunately, after loading this onto Github, I learned that I cannot make an HTTP request from a secure HTTPS server. I tried to make a work around, but it became absolutely ridiculous hahaha. I just 'allowed this site to show insecure content' in the browser settings. I apologize if this is an unacceptable solution - if only the data was being hosted on a secure page (or I was better at 'work arounds').
