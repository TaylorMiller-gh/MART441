## **Week 6** ##

I had a lot of fun with JSON and local storage this week! I also had fun solving the weird random array problem. I had to assign a numerical value to my images since they all had unique names. Local storage can be tricky. I had to make sure that the stored data wasn't being erased in between each page. It seems like there are just numerous containers that I'm keeping track of - the page itself, the console, the cookies, the storage, etc.
