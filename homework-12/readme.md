## **Week 12** ##

The assignment for this week is actually the assignment for week 11. This week was fairly straight forward - I really like HTML5. It's super easy to work with. I keep having the same problem with getters and setters though. If I have 'get' function, the console gets mad if I didn't explicitly make a 'set' function.
