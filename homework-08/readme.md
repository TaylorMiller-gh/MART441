## **Week 8** ##

Jquery is an awesome tool! This is the type of coding tool that I had wanted from the beginning - working in html and css is fine, it just feels awkward and clunky. Jquery is a straightforward, to the point system. I'm still unsure about how to use some of it, and its best practices. I look forward to moving forward with it! Hope you enjoyed the deep ponderings of my site hahaha
