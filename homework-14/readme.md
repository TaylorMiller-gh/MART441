## **Week 14** ##

Three.js seems like a really popular tool. I had trouble getting a material onto my object (and did not succeed) - while I was searching for a solution, I saw quite a few people are making complex projects using Three. These projects had fully materialized buildings, characters, etc. It was all really impressive. Meanwhile, I couldn't get a color to show up on my shell of a BMW haha.
