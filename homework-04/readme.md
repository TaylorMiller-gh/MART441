## **Week 4** ##

This week's content was awesome. I was able to understand these concepts a bit better after going over them again. The hands-on code challenges were great! There was definitely quite a few ways of using these tools that I hadn't really considered at all. I don't think I had ever seen conditionals written in ternary.

I decided to go for a switch case for the decision-making part of this game. To my surprise, it went really well. I tried to handle the 'is alive' part of the game with a while loop and just ran the memory out of my browser. I decided to replace it with an if statement and called it good.
