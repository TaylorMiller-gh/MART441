## **Week 7** ##

There was a lot of material this week, but it was straight-forward and I was familiar with al the content. Nevertheless, it was a fantastic refresher. I had some weird recursion problems with the 'get' and 'set' function, but managed to sort it out (by removing them haha. Oh well.)

I look forward to learning more about classes and objects - there's so much I don't know. I have a lot of questions, but I'll just start rambling with no apparent end. So I will just continue to move forward and take in the course work as it is, saving the questions for later if they are unanswered.
