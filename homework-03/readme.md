## **Week 3** ##

This week turned out to be difficult. I've been using P5.js in MART220 a lot, and forgot it isn't something we've covered in this class. I started making a solution before realizing the library was beyond the scope of this assignment. I re-approached the problem by using 3 divs, 'dialogue,' 'option1,' and 'option2.' I was having a really difficult time getting the buttons (A and B) to function correctly - I tried using a variable to update which state of the conversation I was in and the entire problem was starting to look like a switch statement. At this point, I decided I surely must have overcomplicated the entire problem (as I do) and checked out the examples. I would have never thought to pass in parameters into the function with the buttons - the thought just never occurred. I also would have never used the buttons to hold the responses.

I was a little disheartened by this week. When I accomplish a good bit of code in other programs, I feel confident. This week's problem appeared to be somewhat simple, and I fell flat on my face. I understand that's how some programming problems can be - a complex task may be simple, and vice versa. I should do more coding practice to open my mind up to the variety of possibilities and multiple solutions that come with any problem. At least I got a funny Skyrim story out of it.
