            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> I've lived in Montana my entire life, but I've traveled throughout most of the country.
              I've had a deep interest in art, music, and storytelling since I was a child. After leaving highschool,
              I spent life as an audio engineer for a few years before exploring business managment. Presently,
              I'm finishing school while running several businesses under the guidance of a friend and mentor.
              I'm driven by an unyeilding purpose to help people cultivate peace and happiness through
              stories and digital design.</p>
